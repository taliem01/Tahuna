          comedy, family fun and madness up the mountain. On Thursday 22nd June the celebrations begin and is followed by four
          days of fun, jam-packed with events. From family events to DJs and nightlife - there’s something on the programme for everyone.
          Queenstowners have always loved winter but it was made official when the very first Queenstown Winter Festival took place in 1975.

        <p>
        This is where the Bungy craze all started in 1988. The Kawarau Bridge Bungy Centre is the World Home of Bungy, situated along the picturesque Kawarau River, about a 30min drive out of Queenstown, NZ.
        This original Bungy site is where commercial Bungy Jumping was invented in 1988 by co-founders Henry van Asch and AJ Hackett-
        At the Kawarau Bridge we do a traditional foot-tie style Bungy -
        go at it alone or tandem Jump with a friend.
