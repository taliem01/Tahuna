        <p>
        This is where the Bungy craze all started in 1988. The Kawarau Bridge Bungy Centre is the World Home of Bungy, situated along the picturesque Kawarau River, about a 30min drive out of Queenstown, NZ.
        This original Bungy site is where commercial Bungy Jumping was invented in 1988 by co-founders Henry van Asch and AJ Hackett-
        At the Kawarau Bridge we do a traditional foot-tie style Bungy -
        go at it alone or tandem Jump with a friend.
